# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling

Objectives:
● Wrangle data from various sources
● Store and analyse the wrangled data using visualisation
● Report wrangling efforts and acting efforts

(Step 1) Gathering Data:
Data was gathered from three sources, one was provided as a csv named
“twitter_archive_enhanced.csv”.
The second data was gotten from a url into a file “image_predictions.tsv) using the
requests library.
The last piece of data was accessed via the twitter API using the tweepy library. I loaded
all the tweets data into a “tweet_json.txt” file based on the urls I withdrew from the
“twitter_archive_enhanced.csv” dataset.

(Step 2) Assessing the Data:
Each of the datasets were loaded into dataframes for visual and programmatic
assessment
